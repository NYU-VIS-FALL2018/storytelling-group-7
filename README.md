## About
Manchester City was a mediocre team till 2002 and they played premier league regularly from 2003. Since then the teamâ€™s story goes from a newly promoted team to 3 premier league titles in the last 15 years. The team has gone through a lot of changes during this time. Man City has seen 4 different owners during this period and it has seen a total spending of $1.4 billion dollars in transfers which is the highest spending till date for any team. Man City has truly changed the dynamics of the game.

This drastic trend and change over the past 15 years can be seen which majorly occurred after Khaldoon Al Mubarak became the chairman of the Man City in 2008 since after.

We are going to share this story via multiple visualizations.
